The New MININEC (Version 3): A Mini-Numerical Electromagnetic Code
==================================================================

Re-typeset version of [1]_. 
The reason for preparing this version is that the available original
report is very badly reproduced from microfiche.

Get the `PDF version`_ of the technical report, unfortunately github
doesn't recognize it as a valid PDF, so you need to click on "Download
raw file".

Some of the text in this version was derived from the earlier Mininec
technical report [2]_, which is identical with the newer version in some
passages.

Finally: Paul McMahon VK3DIP sent me a scanned version (from some paper
document he had access to) of the completely unreadable pages in the
document. Without him this project would not have been possible.

The following changes to the original report were adopted in this
version:

- Where capital letters were used for accentuation I've generally used
  LaTeX's builtin mechanisms (e.g. when typesetting section title) using
  larger fonts and/or bold typeface.
- All literature-references were typeset as e.g., "[1]" not as in the
  original as "(reference 1)". An exception to this (where we still use
  the word "reference") is when the reference is used in the sentence.
- Gain in dB over isotropic radiator is denoted as dBi (not, as in the
  original report with a capital I in dBI)
- In Section 4.1 "Getting Started" when describing the menu options (in
  the original on p. 72) I've corrected a typo, where it the original we
  have "change source of excitation (E)" the key was corrected to "(X)".
- Since the literature references are formatted using BiBTeX, we're
  using BiBTeX conventions for the entries and this sometimes changes
  the order of information in an entry. I've also left out some of the
  "Inc" or "Book Company" additions from the publisher information.
- I've not spent the effort of transcribing the program listings.
